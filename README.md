# modularPlateFDTD

A physical modeled modular system that utilizes finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods and consist of a thin plate that can have strings and/or a tube attached using rigid or spring connections. The user can interact with the physical model by exciting the plate with either a bow, hammer or external audio. This plug-in was created by Benjamin Fullerton Støier for a semester project on his 3nd semester of SMC at Aalborg University.
